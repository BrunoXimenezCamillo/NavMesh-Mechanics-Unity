# NavMesh Unity
 Using AI to define the best route and move the character to the destination.
 
In addition to the NavMesh, for this project, I used the Pro Builder package to model the level's environment, Cinemachine to control the camera, and the new Unity Input System to capture player commands. See the result in the video below.
